General branding settings for St. Mark's school within Canvas

## Obsolete

These branding settings were for the pre July 1, 2016 Canvas UI, and are now mostly irrelevant. Much of the functionality in this has been siphoned off into discrete [CanvasHack](https://packagist.org/search/?q=canvashack) plugins.

This repository is retained for archival purposes, but is unlikely to be updated.
